<p>The theme at Decompiled is broadly the intersection of people and computers. I aim to make current advancements as well as the history
in the realm of computers more accessible for a technically curious audience.</p>
<p>Titles I am considering include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum Computers: Breaking the Internet</li>
<li>Truth Circuits: The Logic of Silicone</li>
<li>Archetypes of Startups</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a Matrix homeserver at matrix.decompiled.dev. If you need a client I&rsquo;d recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot</a>
